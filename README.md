# HR_SCHEMA
Oracle SQL

Using the schema that you chose, write SQL scripts to answer your business questions: 

Write an SQL script using the following techniques in order to get the data into a format to answer your business questions. This will probably require several SQL statements and may generate more than one table.
Joining
Aggregating
Subqueries
Functions
Date format manipulation
In writing this SQL script, describe how you made sure the data was clean and accurate. Include at least the following concepts:
Deduplication
Accounting for null values (if null values are expected, explain why)
Ensuring no data that was needed was lost in joins or filtering
Ensuring no unreasonable values appear in the data
Write helpful comments in your SQL code so someone else could read it and understand what you are doing and why 
After the Session:
Complete your project and submit it before the end of the week:

Github  - SQL Code that answers 10 business questions of your own

Create Google Slides OR Powerpoint Presentation to present the answers to 2-3 business questions (3 minutes or less)
Create a LOOM Video to present 2-3 business questions and your conclusions
Your audience is not familiar with SQL - so just discuss the conclusions and recommendations that answer your business questions
Consider adding tables to your presentation
